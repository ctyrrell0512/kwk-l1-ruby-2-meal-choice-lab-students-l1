# Here's an example of a 'snacks' method that returns the meal choice passed in to it and defaults to "cheetos" if nothing is passed in.


# Define breakfast, lunch and dinner methods that return the meal choice passed into them with a default to your favorite.

# Call the methods with puts and your own arguments here. Like this:
#puts snacks
## In our snacks method, the default choice is "Cheetos" Calling snacks like this without specifying a choice will return "Any time, is the right time for Cheetos!" 

def breakfas(food="waffles")
 puts "A great food to have for breakfast is #{food}."
end

def lunch(food ="peanut butter and jelly")
  puts "Try #{food} for "
  
  
breakfast
breakfast("pancakes")
